**Multiple-Choice Questions:**

1. Explain the difference between `wp_query()` and `get_posts()` in WordPress.
   - [ ] a) `wp_query()` is used for complex queries, while `get_posts()` is used for simpler queries.
   - [ ] b) `wp_query()` returns an instance of `WP_Query`, while `get_posts()` returns an array of post objects.
   - [ ] c) `wp_query()` allows more customization options, while `get_posts()` is simpler to use.
   - [ ] d) There is no difference; they can be used interchangeably.

> :exclamation: In my opinion, the question is not correct. There is no function as `wp_query()`, 
there is a class `WP_Query{}`. If you meant `query_posts()` function, the difference is that `query_posts()` changes 
the basic query, while `get_posts()` does not. Also, `get_posts()` returns an array of post objects.

**OOP Code Challenge (WordPress):**

Implement a WordPress plugin using an object-oriented approach that manages a list of employees in a company. The plugin should have the following features:

**Prerequisites:**
- A WordPress environment is set up with the necessary post type and taxonomy already registered for managing employees (e.g., `employees` post type).
- The focus of this code test is on implementing the `Employee` and `Company` classes within a WordPress plugin and their functionalities.

1. Create a class named `Employee` with the following properties:
   - `name` (string): The name of the employee.
   - `position` (string): The position of the employee.
   - `salary` (float): The salary of the employee.

2. Implement the following methods in the `Employee` class:
   - `__construct()`: Initializes the `name`, `position`, and `salary` properties.
   - `get_name()`: Returns the name of the employee.
   - `get_position()`: Returns the position of the employee.
   - `get_salary()`: Returns the salary of the employee.
   - `get_employee_info()`: Returns a formatted string with the employee's name, position, and salary.

3. Create an additional class named `Company` with the following properties:
   - `employees` (array): An array to store instances of the `Employee` class.

4. Implement the following methods in the `Company` class:
   - `add_employee($employee)`: Adds an employee object to the `employees` array.
   - `get_employees()`: Returns the array of employees in the company.
   - `get_employee_count()`: Returns the total number of employees in the company.
   - `get_average_salary()`: Returns the average salary of all employees in the company.

Please provide the complete code for the plugin implementation, including the `Employee` and `Company` classes within the plugin file.

**Submission:**
- Modify the `README.md` file in your forked repository to include your answers to the multiple-choice questions and your code solution to the OOP code challenge.
- Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
- Share the link to your forked repository for evaluation.
